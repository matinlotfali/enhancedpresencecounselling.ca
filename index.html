      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor (#2443) with a Masters of Arts in Counselling & Guidance and
          a Bachelor of Arts in General Psychology. I have 18 years of counselling experience in Vancouver, Canada
          and I have always been a counsellor in good standing with the BC association of clinical counsellors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In counselling sessions, my clients and I work through difficult issues that they have experienced.
          I mostly help my clients by focusing on their strengths and equipping them with the skills to be able to
          recognize their strengths and utilize them to manage their dilemmas. Strengths base dialogue provides
          the opportunity for my clients to focus on their abilities and creativity to gain the resilience which
          will help them to foster healing and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we walk in the path of your lives, together we will tap into your existing strength and develop
          new skills to form a proactive plan to build your future resilience and well-being.
