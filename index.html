      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor (#2443) with a Masters of Arts in Counselling & Guidance and
          a Bachelor of Arts in General Psychology. I have been working as a counsellor-therapist in Vancouver Canada since 2005, 
	  and I have always been a counsellor in good standing with the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In counselling sessions, my clients and I work through difficult issues that they have experienced.
          I mostly help my clients by focusing on their strengths and equipping them with the skills to be able to
          recognize their strengths and utilize them to manage their dilemmas. Strengths-based dialogue provides
          the opportunity for my clients to focus on their abilities and creativity to gain the resilience which
          will help them to foster healing and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we walk in the path of your lives, together we will tap into your existing strengths and develop
          new skills to form a proactive plan to build your future resilience and well-being.
